# Instructor instructions

## Design session

Review the business scenario and business requirements with audience.

Facilitate break-out into design teams.  Try to have teams small enough for everyone to participate while big enough not to have too many teams (as they each present).  Also try to have people with exposure to target services in each team to speed up design.

The design session should be between 30 to 60 minutes.  This is really to prepare the audience for the hands on lab.

Have each team present their design.  Encourage other team to question and challenge each other.  This is a learning exercise. Different teams typically focus more strongly on different aspects, so each team bring a different perspective.

## Preferred solution

Present the [preferred solution](real-time-preferred-solution.vsdx).

Review the [business requirements](../business-context.md) and how each are met in the preferred solution.

## Lab

Start the lab!

This can be done individually or in teams.

The lab is divided into modules.  We recommend "regrouping" at the end of each module to discuss the solution and if necessary, show a working version.

We recommend doing module 1 to 4 as a baseline and considering the other modules in order of interest.

### IoT Events simulation

In order to simulate the IoT events, it is suggested the instructor setup an Azure Container Instance and an Event Hub as described in module 2.

This will allow attendees to be free of thinking about this simulation details.
